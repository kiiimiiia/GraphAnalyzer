# Graph_Analyzer

Our goal is to create a webpage for analyzing Git repositories that allows users to paste the repository link and view an interactive dashboard for analysis. To achieve this, we need to create co-editing networks from these repositories using the tutorials provided in https://github.com/gotec/git2net. Additionally, we need to calculate various measurements such as centralities (https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/centrality.html) for these networks, with a slider that allows users to view how the networks looked at different points in time.

We also need to provide users with the ability to download these measurements, plots, and analysis. For inspiration on interactivity, we found https://webwebpage.github.io/ to be a useful initial step towards our goal.

Lastly, users should have the ability to check several repositories and save them for future reference. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to us.
